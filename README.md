# Calculator-project
This is a simple **GUI-based calculator** built using Python's Tkinter library. It features a clean and visually appealing design with a **sky blue** background, and buttons in **white** for numbers and **light green** for operations. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports the use of parentheses for grouping expressions, enabling more complex calculations. The interface includes a **clear button** for resetting the input and an **equals button** to evaluate the expression. The design is user-friendly with a modern, colorful aesthetic.
